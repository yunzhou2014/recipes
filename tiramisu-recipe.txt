Ingredients:
 - 3 cups of strong black coffee, preferably espresso, cooled
 - 3 tablespoons caster sugar
 - 6 tablespoons Amaretto liqueur (brandy or rum or marsala wine can also be used here.)
 - 2 eggs, separated
 - 250g mascarpone cheese
 - 250ml whipped cream
 - cocoa powder, to dust
 - 1 packet of Savoiardi (sponge lady finger biscuits)

Directions:
 1. Place the cold coffee in a bowl, add three tablespoons of the Amaretto and put
    to one side.
 
 2. In a separate bowl beat together the egg yolks and sugar for about three minutes
    until thick and pale.
 
 3. Add the mascarpone and beat until well mixed. Fold in the whipped cream gently
    with a metal spoon.

 4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold the egg
    whites quickly but gently into the cream mixture. Add the remaining liqueur.

 5. Dip each biscuit into the coffee liqueur mixture for about two seconds on each 
    side and shake of the excess.

 6. Cover the bottom of the dessert glasses. Spread some of the cream mixture over
    the biscuits and then repeat the process again, using up the biscuits and 
    finishing with a cream layer.
    
 7. Smooth the surface and dust the top with the cocoa powder.
 
 8. Refrigerate for about two hours or until firm.
